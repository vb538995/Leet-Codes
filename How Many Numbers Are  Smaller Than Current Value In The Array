//LeetCode : 1365 How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than Current Number
//In this question the Approach to the question is easy as its need just on iterartion ofthe whole elements of the array .
//Just create an array of equal to the size of the given array and jus take one variable , that can count the no. of smaller values than the current value and increment it after comparing
// with all the values. after comparision store the variable values in the array with the same index at which the current value was present.
//Please Like the Repository if you find it beneficial by any chance.

            x=0;
            for(j=0;j<nums.size();j++){
                if(i==j){
                    continue;
                }
                if(nums[j]<nums[i]){
                    x++;
