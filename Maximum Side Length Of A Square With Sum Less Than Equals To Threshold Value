//Leetcode : 1292 Maximum Side Length Of a Square With Sum Less Than Equals to Threshold Value
//This is a tricky question , initially even o was not sure about the question that what is he asking but any chance i got to click to the point what is actually need and the concept 
//behind the output. actuaaly this question shouldn't not be in the medium catergory rather its a good question and need to be shifted to HARD category.
//It is next to impossible to understand the requirement of the question that need.
